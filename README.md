Bloxel
======

Bloxel is a voxel engine written with C# with the XNA Framework.  Cross-platform support is enabled through the Mono framework and MonoGame. The engine has a swappable renderer/mesh-builder and comes with a smooth renderer based off of the paper [Dual Contouring of Hermite Data](http://www.frankpetterson.com/publications/dualcontour/dualcontour.pdf) by Ju et al.
